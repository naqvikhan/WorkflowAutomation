# WorkflowAutomation
An automation tool that simplifies accessing the various applications (such as When2Work, Amazon Connect, Microsoft Remote Desktop, Microsoft Teams etc.) essential for working at school's IT Office.

The tool was made to log in using the imported credentials as well as navigate through the webapps as required.

Additionally, the applications essential for work are also opened.

Typically logging in and setting up the workspace takes around 3-4 minutes. This tool reduces that time to 30 seconds.
